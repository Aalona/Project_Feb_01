# Ideally, all the exercises should be completed (without my help) before the next lesson (ideally Thursday, so I have to time to check them). But at the same time, don't beat yourself up if you're too busy to look at it.
1. Use your empty files to write basic product card. What you'll need is:
- one picture of a product, 
- name of it,
- price,
- brand name.
2. In your HTML file, inside the body tag add a tag with the Brand Name.
3. Below that add tag with a nice product-related class. Place image inside it and then next to it create a block with all additional data:
- Product Name (should be a link leading to ) 
- Brand
- Price
- Add to cart button (shouldn't link to anything at this point)
4. Write CSS that will keep the product card contained within ï¿½300px wide box. Add some colours, background and borders to your elements to make sure they look nice-ish.
